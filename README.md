LEFT OVER LINK

LeftOver Link is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between restaurants with surplus food and NGOs that distribute meals to the underprivileged.
It provides an easy and efficient way for restaurants to list available leftovers and for NGOs to view, request, and collect them — ensuring that good food doesn’t go to waste.
